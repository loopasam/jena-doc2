Title: TDB

TDB is a component of
[Jena](http://jena.apache.org) for RDF storage
and query.  It support the full range of Jena APIs.
TDB can be used as a high performance RDF store on a single machine.
This documentation describes the latest version, unless
otherwise noted.

A TDB store can be accessed and managed with the provided command
line scripts and via the Jena API.

See also [Fuseki](../serving_data/) for a SPARQL server that
uses TDB for persistent storage and provides the SPARQL protocols
for query, update and REST update over HTTP.

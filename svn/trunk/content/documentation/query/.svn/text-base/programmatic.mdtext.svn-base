Title: ARQ - Building Queries Programmatically

It is possible to build queries by building and abstract syntax
tree (as the parser does) or by building the algebra expression for
the query.Â  It is usually better to work with the algebra form as
it is more regular.

See the examples in the ARQ `src-examples/` directory of the ARQ
distribution, particularly `arq.examples.AlgebraExec`.
